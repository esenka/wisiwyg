what i see is what you get

to get this running you need a node server set up just like schiffman does in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec&t=932s <br>
run http-server in the terminal in the folder where you pulled this repo <br>
run your code from localhost so that the camera works
