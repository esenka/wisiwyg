what i see is what you get

to get this running you need a node server set up just like schiffman does in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec&t=932s <br>
run http-server in the terminal in the folder where you pulled this repo <br>
run your code from localhost so that the camera works


# updates 22.11.2020
attnGAN connected to the labels and charRNN generated. !every character is logged to console.
canvas size made bigger to house both screens in
new io.socket added

# how to use runway
open Runway ML and run the model attnGAN LOCALLY with the input being HTTP
run the sketch.js file in atom server.
it works!

things left:
-final export version (combining text & image)
-ability to export
-a bit css polishing
